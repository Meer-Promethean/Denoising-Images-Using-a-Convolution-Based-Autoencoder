##  Denoising Images Using a Convolution-Based Autoencoder

### Objective
Train a convolution-based autoencoder on an image dataset. The autoencoder should be trained to remove noise from the images, similar to the process demonstrated in class.

---

### Instructions:

1. **Dataset Selection**:
   - Research on Kaggle and choose any large image dataset of your choice. 
   - Ensure that the dataset is diverse and contains a sufficient number of images for effective training.

2. **Add Noise to Images**:
   - Add random noise to the images in the dataset to simulate noisy data.
   - You can use Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, or any other noise type.

3. **Train Autoencoder**:
   - Build and train a convolution-based autoencoder to denoise the images.
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Train the model on noisy images and validate its performance using the clean (original) images.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the autoencoderâ€™s performance on the test set.
   - Visualize the results by showing examples of noisy input images, the corresponding clean images, and the autoencoder's outputs.
